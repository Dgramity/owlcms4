* Release Highlights: 
  * Enhancement: added checkbox to enable Masters W75 and W80+ age groups for national federations that have gender-equality rules (#242)
  * Enhancement: allow Masters federations to have M30 and W30 age groups.  This is achieved by explicitly setting the MASTERS age division on the concerned athletes (otherwise they are classified as senior) (#246)
  * Enhancement: make it easier to run a "Masters-style" competition with non-masters age groups -- in that mode, kids 12 and under, youth 17 and under, junior 20 and under, as well as senior under 35 are considered to be separate Masters-style age groups.  However, some athletes over 35 may want to compete as senior instead of Masters.  This can be done on a case-by-case basis by setting their age division to SENIOR which will override the age group calculation. (#246)
  * Enhancement: the ordering of the fields on the Registration and Weigh-in pages is more consitent.  The only difference is that on the Registration page the identification fields come first, whereas on the weigh-in page the weight and declaration fields come first. (#247)
