## **Changes for release 4.33.1-beta01**

##### Changes since last pre-release

- 4.33.1-beta01: Standardized the display options dialog between owlcms and publicresults
- 4.33.1-alpha00: Shared styling between owlcms and publicresults.
  - publicresults scoreboard now uses the same colors.css and results.css stylesheets as owlcms.  owlcms sends the exact files it is using for itself
  - Priority order: 1. css in an uploaded zip,  2. css in local/styles,  3. css found in owlcms distribution.
- 4.33.1-alpha00: Swedish translation

#### Changes for 4.33

- Records
  - Records are shown if record definition Excel spreadsheets are present in the local/records directory.  See the following folder for examples: [Sample Record Files](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sbr804kqfwkgs6g/AAAEcT2sih9MmnrpYzkh6Erma?dl=0) . 
  - Records definitions are read when the program starts.  Records set during the competition are updated on the scoreboard, but the Excel files need to be updated manually to reflect the official federation records.
  - Records are shown according to the sorting order of the file names. Use a numerical prefix to control the order (for example 10Canada.xlsx, 20Commonwealth.xlsx, 30PanAm.xlsx).
  - All records potentially applicable to the current athlete are shown on the scoreboard.  Records that would be improved by the next lift are highlighted.  If there are too many athletes in a group the records can be hidden using the display-specific settings, or by adding `records=false` to the URL
  - Added large notifications in the record section for record attempts and new records.  You can hide the scoreboard record notifications by setting the `--showRecordNotifications` variable at the top of `colors.css` to `hidden` if you do not want them.
- Sinclair meets
  - If the feature switch `SinclairMeet` is defined on the Language and Settings page, then the scoreboard hides the lift and total ranks, and shows the Sinclair and Sinclair rank.  Also, the leaders section uses the Sinclair ranking.
- Documentation now includes a tutorial on how to change the scoreboard colors: [Scoreboard Colors](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Styles) 
- Additional fields on the scoreboards
  - Added the custom1 and custom2 fields to the scoreboards (after the year of birth).  They are hidden by default; change the width to non-zero and visibility to `visible` in results.css in order to show one or the other or both.
- Masters rulebook
  - Updated the default AgeGroups.xlsx definition file for the W80, W85, M85 and M85 age categories.
  - Updated the age-adjusted Sinclair calculation for women to use the SMHF coefficients.
- New: Announcer can act as solo athlete-facing referee. A setting on the announcer screen (âš™) enables emitting down signal on decision so it is heard and shown on displays.
- New: Round-robin "fixed order" option for team competitions.  If this option is selected in the Competition Non-Standard Rules, athletes lift according to their lot number on each round. The lot number can be preset at registration or drawn at random depending on competition rules.
- New: 24h time will now be used in the date-time picker when using English outside of the "traditional" English-speaking countries ("AU", "GB", "IN", "NZ", "PH", "US", "ZA").  On a laptop, the country is obtained from the operating system.  If using English in the cloud, we recommend setting the `OWLCMS_LOCALE` environment variable to `en_SE` in order to get English with consistent ISO date and 24h time formatting throughout the program.

### Highlights from recent stable releases

- On weigh-in or registration forms, if a change in category results, a confirmation is required (#499)
- Requested weight is now shown on attempt board (including loading chart) and on top of scoreboard during breaks (but hidden during ceremonies).
- Announcer is notified when weight on bar needs to change.
- Officials scheduling and registration templates:
  - Registration import-export spreadsheet changed to add additional columns for Marshal2 and TechnicalController2. Added a report page in the export that shows the assignments for each official.
  - The Start List document has an Officials tab that shows official assignments for each group according to the introduction order.
- New parameterized scoreboards.  Colors can be changed in the `styles/colors.css` file (*The default colors are the same as the previous defaults).*  See [Customization](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/UploadingLocalSettings) for how to proceed. The scoreboards can be zoomed in or out using the  `Ctrl+` and `Ctrl-` keys to accommodate more lines, or to make text bigger with smaller groups.
- Improved management of ceremonies : see [Breaks and Ceremonies](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Breaks) procedures, and [Result Documents](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Documents) for the medals spreadsheet.
- [Jury](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Jury) console now supports summoning the referees either individually or all together. The jury console now allows direct reversal/confirmation of lifts (#435, #427)  
- The [Refereeing](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Refereeing) screen (typically used on phones or tablets) now displays notifications when a decision is expected or when the jury summons the referee.
- It is now possible to build affordable physical devices to receive instructions from owlcms (decision expected, jury calls referee) using MQTT. Software and circuit schematics are available at [this location](http://github.com/jflamy/owlcms-esp32).
- Video Streaming: Support for Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) automated scene switching.  Added [documentation](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/OBSSceneSwitching) for all supported transitions.
- It is now possible to choose and override the Excel templates for competitions cards, the start list, the starting weight sheet, the results (protocol), and the final package (attempts, sinclair, robi, team results, etc.)
- It is now possible to Export and Import the database content (#449).  This allows taking a snapshot of the database in the middle of a competition. It also allows bringing back a Heroku database for local use, and conversely, setting up a competition locally prior to loading on Heroku.
- Explicit support for participation to multiple age groups (#433)
- All resources in the local directory take precedence over the built-in ones (visual styles, templates, age group definitions, sounds, etc.)
- Implemented the <u>rules to prevent athletes from moving down their requested weight illegally</u>.  Moving down is denied if the athlete should already have attempted that weight according to the official lifting order.  The exact checks resulting from applying the TCRR to that situation are spelled out in the [documentation](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Announcing#rules-for-moving-down). (#418)
- Violations of <u>rules for timing of declarations</u> (before initial 30 seconds), and for changes (before final warning) are now signaled as errors (#425, #426). Overriding is possible for officiating mistakes.
