# owlcms4
Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System (rewrite using Vaadin Flow)

Tentative rewrite of [owlcms2](https://owlcms2.sf.net) to use Vaadin Flow.
Main incentive is the availability of Web Component integration, which will enable easier integration of features
running locally in the browser. 
This will make it possible to run the application in the cloud, with timers and referee decisions (down signal) running locally to avoid the latency.

Why owlcms4?  There was an owlcms3 rewrite done using Vaadin version 8, but the off-line features were too difficult to implement
and I lost interest.
