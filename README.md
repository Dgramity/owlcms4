# owlcms4
## Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 

This project is a full rewrite of [owlcms](https://owlcms2.sourceforge.io/#!index.md), which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions since 2009.  The core engine that embodies the competition rules has been adapted, everything else has been completely redone. 

Main incentives for this rewrite:
- Ability to run in the cloud: Decisions, timers and sounds are now handled locally in the browser.  This will reduce or eliminate the need for ethernet cables since the browsers don't rely on the server for timing.
- Simplicity and robustness: The new version relies on far fewer libraries, that are either very broadly used industry standards with long-term sustainability, or simple enough that they can be fixed.

### Current status

The current release is able to run a regular or masters regional competition (no jury -- will be added back in a future release).

- For the current status, see
  -  [Project board](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/projects/1) This shows what we are working on, and the order we are following
  -  [Issues and enhancement requests](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/issues) This is the full log of requests and planned enhancements.
  
- The following key features are present
  - **Announcer, marshall and timekeeper** screens (updating athlete cards and recomputing lifting order).
  - **Attempt board with timing and decisions** handled locally in the browser. USB/Bluetooth keypresses are processed directly in the browser for refereeing (see demo walkthrough below for mapping).
  - **Athlete-facing decision display** (decision display reversed to match referee positions as seen from platform).  Can also be used for keypress refereeing.
  - **Scoreboard** for public or warm-up room display.  Shows timer, down and decision lights.
  - **Athlete Registration and Weigh-in screens**, including production of **weigh-in sheet** with starting weights and **athlete cards**.
  - Working entry screens for defining a competition (general info, groups, categories, etc.)
  - **Multiple fields of play** (platforms)
  - **Upload of registration sheet** (same format as owlcms2, in either xls or xlsx format)
  - Countdown timer for breaks (before introduction, before first snatch, break before clean and jerk, technical break)
  - Production of **group results/protocol sheets**
  - Option to treat the competition as a **Masters competition** with proper processing of age groups.
  - 3 and 5-person jury is planned for an upcoming release

### Licensing and Caveats
This is free, as-is, no warranty *whatsoever* software. If you just want to run it as is for your own club or federation, just download and go ahead. 

If however you wish to sell or host the software as a service to others, or if you create a modified version, the license *requires* you to make full sources and building instructions of the modified version available for free, so that anyone who wants to compile or further modify the software always has the option of doing so on her own (see the [License](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for details.)

The software is meant to comply with the current IWF Technical Competition Rules and Regulations (TCRR) and with the current Masters Weightlifting rules, except for the refereeing devices (visual and sound reminders). You should perform your own tests to see if the software is fit for your own purposes and circumstances.

### Installation
[Ready-to-run Releases](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/releases) are available at [https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/releases](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/releases) . The releases can be run either locally (on any machine where Java8 is available), or on the cloud. [Installation Instructions](<https://jflamy.github.io/owlcms4/#!index.md>) are available for both local installations and for running on the Heroku cloud service.

### Outside our control

- Use a recent version of Chrome or Firefox on a laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux).  I do not have access to a recent iPad to figure out the wonky Apple Safari quirks to make it work properly, sorry. Donations of a Mac developer laptop welcome (cheaper than getting Apple to line up with the rest of the web world).
- Chrome has decided that sounds will no longer play automatically.  In order to hear the down signal, you need to go to page ``chrome://flags``. Search for ``autoplay policy`` and set it to ``No user gesture is required`` .  If you don't do this, you will not hear the sounds.

### Demo
A [Live demo](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) of the current build is available on the Heroku cloud service.
- Note that the cloud demo application is not pre-loaded and uses a zero-cost service, so the first load can take a minute. This is *not* indicative of subsequent cloud loads neither is it indicative of local performance (both of which start in a few seconds)
- There is a single demo database, which resets itself periodically when the Heroku application times out. So if someone else is playing around, you may see surprising things.
- Suggested steps:
    - Click on "Lifting Group" in the menu
    - Click on "Announcer". A new tab opens.  Select a group ("M1" or "M2") in the top bar.
    - You can start and stop the clock with the "play" and "pause" buttons.
    - Start time for the athlete and stop the clock after a few seconds.
    - The announcer can enter manual flag/thumbs-up/down decisions using the buttons at the right.
    - Go back to the first home tab you opened and go to "Setup Displays" in the menu
    - Start an Attempt Board and click on the black area. You can then use the keyboard keys 1 3 5 to enter white and 2 4 6 to enter red decisions.  Down signal will appear after two identical.
    - You can also start a Result Board.
    - If you go back to the main screen and change the group, you should see all the screens change to the new group.

### Building from source
This is a standard Maven project.  If you so wish, you can build the binaries from this source.  
- Install Java 8 and the support for Maven and Git in your favorite development environment. Eclipse Java IDE includes the M2E and EGit plugins and works fine -- the project includes the settings file for that configuration.
- Clone this repository.
- Running ``mvn package`` inside the owlcms subdirectory should give you a working .jar and .zip in the target directory.

You are welcome to make improvements and correct issues.  If you do, please clone this repository and create a pull request.

### Design notes:
Local timer and decision is done using [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)

[Vaadin Flow](https://vaadin.com/flow) is used for programming because it integrates natively with Web Components and enables the use of robust libraries
- The overall navigation and layout is done using [vaadin-app-layout](https://github.com/appreciated/vaadin-app-layout)
- Administrative and technical official screens are built using [crudui](https://github.com/alejandro-du/crudui)

- Event-based design, strict separation between the presentation, the field-of-play business layer, and the back-end data

- JPA is used to ensure datababse independence (H2 locally, Postgres on Heroku cloud, etc.)

- Why is it called owlcms4? First there was owlcms. Did a major cleanup, and moved the code to sourceforge, owlcms2 was born. A few years back I started an owlcms3 rewrite, but it was too tedious to implement the off-line features I wanted, so I gave up until Vaadin Flow came out to rekindle my interest.
