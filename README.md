# OWLCMS - Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 
This software is a complete rewrite of `owlcms` which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions since 2009. 

### Features, Documentation and Demo

See the application [Web Site](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#) for a full overview.  See [this page](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/Demo) for a live demo.

### Basic Installation Options
Several installation options are possible, depending on what is available at the competition site

#### Easiest: Cloud-Based Installation (Internet required)

If there is good internet communication at the competition site, there is no need to install anything locally. 

- There is a one-click install procedure to a free (0$) cloud service called Heroku (a division of Salesforce.com). 
- The install will create your own private copy of the application, with your own database.
- The owlcms software runs as a web site. All the various display screens and devices connect to the cloud using the competition site's wifi or ethernet network.

#### Stand-alone: Laptop installation

If there is no Internet connectivity at your competition site, you can use a stand-alone setup and run the software on a laptop.

- The software runs on a laptop (labeled owlcms in the diagram). 

- All the other screens and officials connect to that laptop using only a web browser, so you can use whatever you want (old laptops, chromebooks, tablets, firetv sticks, etc.).  All the communications take place over a local network (wifi or ethernet).

- You can run owlcms on the same machine as one of the officials.  It is often the case that owlcms runs on the same machine as the announcer or the competition secretary.  In the simplest setups, there is just the announcer, and maybe one scoreboard.

- You can referee using hand signals, flags, phones, or dedicated devices. See [this page](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/Refereeing)

### Virtual Competitions and Individual Scoreboards

There are additional modules available to support more involved scenarios.  For example, it is possible to have individual scoreboards available to every coach -- supporting physical distancing.  This can also be used to provide individual scoreboards to every member of the public watching the competition remotely.

A competition with a main site and remote gyms connected by videoconferencing could look as follows
