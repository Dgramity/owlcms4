Some modifications to the rules can be used to simplify the proceedings of a virtual competition.

1. **Round-robin ordering**.  Within a group, athletes take their first snatch attempt from lightest to heaviest weight.  Then a short pause is given where athletes can declare their second attempt.  Then all second attempts are taken.  A second pause is given to adjust third attempts. Then all athletes take their third attempts.  The process is then repeated for clean and jerk.
   
   Depending on the competition rules, changes may be allowed (or not) once an attempt is started.  It will be the marshal's role to accept changes or not.
   
2. **Gender-based ordering**.  Within a mixed group, all women go first, then all men.  

3. **Both modifications together**: in this scenario, all women take first snatch, then men take first snatch.  Short pause for weight declaration.  All women take second snatch, all men take second snatch, and so on.  Changes may take place during the attempt, depending on the whether or not the competition rules allow it.
