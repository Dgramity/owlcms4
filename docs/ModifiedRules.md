Two modifications to the rules can be used to simplify the proceedings of a virtual competition.

1. **Round-robin ordering**.  Within a group, athletes take their first snatch attempt from lightest to heaviest weight.  Then a short pause is given where athletes can change their second attempt.  Then all second attempts are taken (no changes allowed).  A second pause is given to adjust third attempts. Then all athletes take their third attempts.  
   The process is then repeated for clean and jerk.
2. **Gender-based ordering**.  Within a mixed group, all women go first, then all men.  
3. **Both modifications together**: in a mixed virtual competition, all women take first snatch, then men take first snatch.  Short weight-adjustment pause.  All women take second snatch, all men take second snatch, and so on.
