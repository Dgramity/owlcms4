Weigh-ins take place for each group, so the buttons for the weigh-in officials is on the Lifting Group page.

## Selecting a group

The first step is to select the group being weighed-in.

## Athlete Cards

Athlete Cards are the cards that will be used by the Marshall to record changes.  If a printer is available on site, you may wish to wait until before the weigh-in to print them out.

Athlete cards are produced as an Excel document which can be printed.

## Entering information

The athlete's body weight, category, age division, starting weights should now be entered.  The athlete is selected by clicking ONCE in the list.

Various validations are made by OWLCMS and errors are signaled. For example, the category must fit with the gender and the body weight.

If enabled on the Competition Information page, the 20kg rule will be enforced. In this example, a typo meant that 16 was entered instead of 106.

## Start Numbers

Start numbers are used to ensure that lighter weight categories lift before heavier weight categories even if the same weight is requested.  Start numbers cannot, therefore, be generated before a group has been weighed-in.

## Starting Weight Sheet

The starting weight sheet shows the start number and the requested weights.  It is often used to cross-check that the information printed is the same as on the athlete cards, and conversely, to write down the start numbers on the athlete cards.

It is often also used as a protocol sheet -- an official will fill in the good and bad lifts as a backup copy.
