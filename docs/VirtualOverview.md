# Cloud-Based Virtual Competitions

In a virtual competition, the officials and athletes are in multiple locations.  

- In order to allow referees to see the athletes, a videoconferencing software is used. Zoom is well suited for this task. This also allows coaches to communicate declarations and weight changes.
- In order to allow access by all officials, `owlcms` is run in the cloud and supports remote refereeing -- see the following [page](Refereeing#Mobile-Device-Refereeing) for details. Remote referees need to use a laptop because a proper screen is needed for refereeing but unfortunately iPads do not support simultaneous use of video and of the refereeing application.

Two cloud-based applications are used.  The officials use owlcms.  A second application called publicresults makes the scoreboard available.  Because they run on two different computers, they can be scaled up independently.

If you wish to control the full setup and are technology-savvy, alternatives to using Heroku are possible, for example, [Kubernetes on Digital Ocean Cloud](DigitalOcean) or [Home Kubernetes Hosting with Secure Internet Access](k3d)
