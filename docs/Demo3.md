## Live Demo

A [Live Version](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) of the current build is available on the Heroku cloud service.  After looking at the videos above, you should be able to use the demo to play around.  

- **Note that the cloud demo application is hosted on a free service, and is not pre-loaded. A delay of about one minute is normal on the first startup**. This is ***not*** indicative of subsequent cloud accesses neither is it indicative of local performance (which start in a few seconds).


- There is a single demo database, which resets itself periodically when the Heroku application times out. So if someone else is playing around, you may see surprising things.
