## Live Demo

A [Live Version](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) of the current build is available on the Heroku cloud service.  After looking at the two tutorial videos ([Simple Club Meet](Demo1), [Standard Competition](Demo2)), you should be able to use the program to play around.  

- **Note that the cloud demo application is hosted on a free service, and is not pre-loaded. A delay of 15 to 30 seconds is normal on the first startup**. This is ***not*** indicative of subsequent cloud accesses neither is it indicative of local performance (which start in a few seconds).


- The demo database resets itself periodically when the Heroku application times out. Also, if someone else has played around before you did, or at the same time you do, you may see surprising things.  You can always configure your own copy using the [Heroku free setup instructions](Heroku)
