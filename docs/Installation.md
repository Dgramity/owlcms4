# owlcms4 Installation Instructions

There are two main modes of operation for owlcms4

  * [Local Setup](LocalSetup.md) : In this mode, the competition management software is installed on a well-performing laptop  running at the competition site (typically, the laptop used by the competition secretary).  No internet connection is required. The various screens and displays use a Web browser to connect to the master laptop. 

    See [Equipment Setup](EquipmentSetup.md) for a picture.

  * [Cloud Setup](Heroku.md): in this mode, there is nothing to install on a local laptop (other than for the competition secretary who needs to print Excel spreadsheets).  The competition software runs in the cloud, meaning that it is installed on a machine somewhere in the Internet.  What makes this attractive is that there are free or low-cost options for doing this.  This is a good option if you have a good internet connection available from the competition site.  

    Again see [Equipment Setup](EquipmentSetup.md) for a picture, bearing in mind that in the cloud setup the competition site router must be connected to the Internet to access the software.
