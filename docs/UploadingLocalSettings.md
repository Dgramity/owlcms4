### Local Customization

If you want to customize the Excel templates, CSS style sheets, or Age Group definitions, proceed as follows

1. Install owlcms locally

2. Locate the `local` folder where owlcms is installed

3. There is a folder for each kind of items (`agegroups`, `templates`, `styles`, etc.)
4. Edit the items you want and test locally

   - Note that for editing CSS style sheets you should activate Developer mode in your Chrome, Edge or Firefox browser (F12) and under the Network settings, disable the cache.  Style sheets and other resources are cached for one week, so you may need to clear caches on your display browsers if you fix things during a meet.

   > Owlcms attempts to preserve your local files when you re-install a newer version.  It is always prudent, however to create a zip file with your setup, as a backup.  You can also use that zip file for cloud-based setups, as explained below.

### Uploading to a cloud-based setup

Cloud-based setups are created on demand, and do not include persistent local files.  The local customizations are stored inside the database as a zip file, and unzipped when the application starts (or a new zip is uploaded).

In order to use your customized files in a cloud setup, proceed as follows

1. Create a zip file of the `local` folder
2. Go to the Preparation > Technical Configuration section of the Cloud-based application
3. Upload your zip.  You can re-upload the zip as needed.
