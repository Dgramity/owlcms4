# Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 

OWLCMS version 4 is a full rewrite of [owlcms](https://owlcms2.sourceforge.io/#!index.md), which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions world-wide since 2009.  This new version has been rebuilt for robustness and simplicity, and can be [run on the cloud](EquipmentSetup#cloud-access-over-the-internet).

## Features and Demo

- See [this page](Demo) for how to access a [demo site](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) and a perform a simple walkthrough
  
  - All the screenshots for the documentation on this site come from the demo. You may therefore use the [demo site](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) to perform a full walkthrough.
  
- The following list is a sampling of the many features available.  <u>*Click on the images if you wish to view them full-sized*</u>.
  
  - Run a **regular** or **masters** competition, with or without a **jury**.
