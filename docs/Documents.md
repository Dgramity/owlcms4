From the `Result Documents` page, it is possible to get a protocol sheet for each group, and a full results package.

## Group Results

The Group Results button opens a page where it is possible

- To correct a mistake on a result in a group that has finished lifting

- To select a group and produce a result sheet

- If no group is selected, all the lifters are included.  This is typically the format expected to send results to a federation.

  In the current version, the template used is determined by the language.  The ability to pick from a list of templates will be reintroduced in an upcoming release.

## Competition Package

The competition package contains the 6-lift results for men and women, the Robi rankings, and the team results.

In the current version, only the standard package is available. The ability to pick alternate competition packages with alternate team points schemes will be reintroduced in an upcoming release.
