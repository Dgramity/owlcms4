## Starting screens or displays from the main laptop

On the laptop where you started owlcms, you can type http://localhost:8080 to get at the program.  Typically, this is where you will run the competition secretary tasks.

## Starting screens or displays from other laptops

Any additional screen you want to use (for TVs, projectors, or additional screens for officials) requires a laptop or a small PC.  A Web browser is run on each PC, and the browser drives the screen.

If you start a browser on the main laptop, the home screen shows a list of Web addresses that you can use to connect additional browsers to owlcms.  These addresses will typically look something similar to

```
http://192.168.0.100:8080
```

but they change depending on the network you are connecting to and how it was configured.  There will normally be several such addresses if WIFI is enabled on the router.

1. If the additional laptop is connected using ethernet wiring to a router, use the address labeled `(wired)` in the list. 
2. If your laptop is not connected using an ethernet cable, use the address labeled ```(wireless)```
3. There may be several addresses listed for each kind; try them in turn, or else ask the person who configured the router
4. If none of the addresses work, or if only the localhost (127.0.0.1) address shows up, ask the person who configured the router or the server laptop.
