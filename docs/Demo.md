A [Live demo](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) of the current build is available on the Heroku cloud service.

- Note that the cloud demo application is not pre-loaded and uses a zero-cost service, so the first load can take a minute. This is *not* indicative of subsequent cloud loads neither is it indicative of local performance (both of which start in a few seconds)
- There is a single demo database, which resets itself periodically when the Heroku application times out. So if someone else is playing around, you may see surprising things.

Suggested steps for a walkthrough:

- Click on "Run a Lifting Group" in the menu
- Click on "Announcer". A new tab opens.  Select a group ("M1" or "M2") in the top bar.
- You can start and stop the clock with the "play" and "pause" buttons: Start time for the athlete and stop the clock after a few seconds.
- The announcer can enter manual flag/thumbs-up/down decisions using the buttons at the right.
- Go back to the first tab you opened and go to "Setup Displays" in the menu
- Start an Attempt Board and click on the black area. You can then use the keyboard keys 1 3 5 to enter white and 2 4 6 to enter red decisions (this is how you can simulate simple refereeing devices).  Down signal will appear after two identical. See the [Refereeing](Refereeing) page for details.
- You can also start a Scoreboard.
- If you go back to the announcer screen and change the group, you should see all the screens change to the new group.
