## Video Demo 1: Solo Mode

The following video gives you a 3 minute overview of how owlcms operates.  For best viewing, use the Full Screen icon at the bottom right.

The demo is representative of a simple club meet.  A single person acts as announcer, timekeeper and marshall.  A second tablet or laptop is used in the warm-up area for athletes to follow the lifting order.

## Video Demo 2: Full Competition Setup

This second video shows how a full competition with the normal technical officials can take place.  Since all that is required for each official is a browser, this setup works just as well for a [virtual meet](VirtualOverview) held over videoconferencing.

## Live Demo

A [Live Version](https://owlcms4.herokuapp.com) of the current build is available on the Heroku cloud service.  After looking at the videos above, you should be able to use the demo to play around.  

- **Note that the cloud demo application is hosted on a free service, and is not pre-loaded. A delay of 15 to 30 seconds is normal on the first startup**. This is ***not*** indicative of subsequent cloud accesses neither is it indicative of local performance (which start in a few seconds).


- There is a single demo database, which resets itself periodically when the Heroku application times out. So if someone else is playing around, you may see surprising things.
