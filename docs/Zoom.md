# Running a Virtual Competition on Zoom

## Preparing

1. Zoom is a widely available well-known software with the required features to hold a meet virtually.  You will need a license for Zoom, since meets last longer than the 40 minutes free version. 
2. You should set up different meetings in advance in Zoom for the weigh-ins and for the competition groups, since weigh-ins overlap with sessions. 
   - If you anticipate that the schedule will be hard to keep, it may be a good idea to schedule individual meetings for each group, to avoid people coming in prematurely to the waiting room when a session has not ended.
3. Send the following directives to each participating team:
   1. A phone or laptop with Zoom must be setup to show the platform.  The video should be in horizontal mode.
   2. Ideally, a second device with a keyboard, such as a laptop, is used to also connect to Zoom and type weight declarations and changes.
   3. Finally, it will be possible to also look at the remote scoreboard through the web, on a laptop or tablet.  The setup below shows the scoreboard on Zoom, but this requires flipping between the two views, as explained in [User instructions for Zoom](UserInstructionsForZoom)

## Running

The following directives should be sent to each team participating

1. When connecting to the Zoom meeting for their competition group, each gym should rename their video session to the LAST NAME of each athlete present (separated by "/" if more than one)
2.  **All** declarations and changes will be **sent by chat**, to <u>Everyone</u>, using the athlete's **LAST name and the requested weight**.
3. Each team must be available on Zoom <u>15 minutes before the start of group</u>. The technical controller will go through all the video setups and make sure that athletes and platforms are correctly visible.
4. Each gym is fully responsible for making sure that they are ready when the camera switches to their location. 
   1. The bar should already be loaded with the correct weight
   2. The bar should be angled 45 degrees such that the small plates and collar are visible to the camera.
   3. Meet-specific rules may state that time starts immediately when the athlete is called, since having the proper weight loaded is entirely under the control of the team. 
5. Any Zoom session not used to broadcast a platform should turn off video -- all the chat-only sessions for weight changes should be video off.
   - This allows the host to hide the non-video participants, leaving only the platforms and making athlete switching much easier
